Included a file converter that updates your storage to the new (better) layout. WARNING: The converter is not able to convert information related to shops that contain "-" in their name.
If you happen to have affected shops you can manually fix your storage. One thing the converter does is replacing the separation symbol '-' with ":".
That step will go wrong if your shop name or shopitem name contains "-". You can simply fix it by setting the ':' in your shop name or shopitem name back to "-".
